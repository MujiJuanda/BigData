# LFW Face Recognition - SVM vs CNN

This repository contains my Machine Learning project for the Big Data course, focusing on Face Recognition using the LFW (Labeled Faces in the Wild) dataset. The main goal is to improve face detection, especially for blurry or unclear images.
Project Overview

This project explores different approaches to face recognition:

    Previous Method: Implemented using CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks).
    Current Method: Using SVM (Support Vector Machine) to improve accuracy.

The motivation behind this project is to enhance face recognition capabilities, particularly for blurry or low-quality images, ensuring better detection and classification.
